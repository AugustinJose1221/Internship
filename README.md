# Realtime Video Stitching using Scale Invariant Feature Transform

This project aims to stitch the video outputs from two camera sensor into one complete video. The process involves, extracting features points from each frame of the video, matching keypoints with the images, generate a homography matrix and stitching and warping the images.
